You can use any C++ IDE you wish to do your assignments in this course as long as the code you
submit compiles and executes on the CSIL computers. Why? Because your assignments will be
marked using this platform (Linux and C++ - version running on CSIL computers). So, the
suggestion is to compile and execute your code using your makefile (g++) at the Linux command
line in CSIL before you submit your assignment to CourSys.
